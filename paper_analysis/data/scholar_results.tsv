ChatGPT performed at or near the passing threshold for all three exams without any specialized training or reinforcement. Additionally, ChatGPT demonstrated a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations. These results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education, and potentially, even clinical decision-making.	medRxiv	12/20/2022	[{'authorId': '2076041163', 'name': 'Tiffany H.

The Implications of Large Language Models for Medical Education and Knowledge Assessment	Background: ChatGPT is a 175 billion parameter natural language processing model which can generate conversation style responses to user input. Objective: To evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as analyze responses for user interpretability. Methods: We used two novel sets of multiple choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT's performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the userbase. The second, was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Free 120-question exams. After prompting ChatGPT with each question, ChatGPT's selected answer was recorded, and the text output evaluated across three qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question. Results: On the four datasets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free- Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44%, 42%, 64.4%, and 57.8%. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.012) within the AMBOSS- Step1 dataset. We found logical justification for ChatGPT's answer selection was present in 100% of outputs. Internal information to the question was present in >90% of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was respectively 54.5% and 27% lower for incorrect relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 and NBME-Free-Step2 datasets (P<=.001). Conclusion: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free- Step-1 dataset we show that the model is comparable to a third year medical student. Additionally, due to the dialogic nature of the response to questions, we demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to provide reasoning and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as a medical education tool.	medRxiv	12/26/2022	[{'authorId': '2107029904', 'name': 'A.

Methods We gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated. Results All ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journalâ€™s formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing. Conclusion ChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.	bioRxiv	12/27/2022	[{'authorId': '2149285611', 'name': 'Catherine A.

ChatGPT developed by OpenAI is one such implementation of a large, pre-trained language model that has gained immense popularity among early adopters, where certain users go to the extent of characterizing it as a disruptive technology in many domains. Understanding such early adoptersâ€™ sentiments is important because it can provide insights into the potential success or failure of the technology, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-method study using 10,732 tweets from early ChatGPT users. We ï¬rst use topic modelling to identify the main topics and then perform an in-depth qualitative sentiment analysis of each topic. Our results show that the majority of the early adopters have expressed overwhelmingly positive sentiments related to topics such as Disruptions to software development , Entertainment and exercising creativity . Only a limited percentage of users expressed concerns about issues such as the potential for misuse of ChatGPT, especially regarding topics such as Impact on educational aspects . We discuss these ï¬ndings by providing speciï¬c examples for each topic and then detail implications related to addressing these concerns for both researchers and users.

We expect that the convincing performance of ChatGPT incentivizes users to apply it to a variety of downstream tasks, including prompting the model to simplify their own medical reports. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory case study. In a questionnaire, we asked 15 radiologists to assess the quality of radiology reports simplified by ChatGPT. Most radiologists agreed that the simplified reports were factually correct, complete, and not potentially harmful to the patient. Nevertheless, instances of incorrect statements, missed key medical findings, and potentially harmful passages were reported. While further studies are needed, the initial insights of this study indicate a great potential in using large language models like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains.

Una forma en la que ChatGPT podrÃ­a ser Ãºtil en la comunicaciÃ³n cientÃ­fica es como una herramienta para ayudar a comunicar las investigaciones de manera mÃ¡s clara y accesible para el pÃºblico en general. Otra forma en la que esta inteligencia artificial (IA) podrÃ­a ser Ãºtil es como una herramienta para contribuir a los cientÃ­ficos y acadÃ©micos a mantenerse al dÃ­a con las Ãºltimas investigaciones y desarrollos en su campo de trabajo. Especialmente el ChatGPT podrÃ­a ser utilizado para recopilar y resumir artÃ­culos cientÃ­ficos y otras publicaciones relevantes de manera automatizada, lo que podrÃ­a ayudar a los cientÃ­ficos a ahorrar tiempo y esfuerzo al tener que leer y analizar cada artÃ­culo por sÃ­ mismos. Un elemento crucial en algunos tipos de estudios, la sÃ­ntesis de literatura, sea para una revisiÃ³n narrativa o panorÃ¡mica, el uso de ChatGPT permitirÃ­a generar resÃºmenes o abstracts de investigaciones de manera mÃ¡s eficiente, o incluso a redactar secciones de un artÃ­culo cientÃ­fico que requieran menos anÃ¡lisis crÃ­tico o interpretaciÃ³n. Sin embargo, la escritura de un artÃ­culo cientÃ­fico completo requiere un conocimiento profundo del campo de investigaciÃ³n y la habilidad para analizar y sintetizar datos de manera crÃ­tica.

Research shows that learning a foreign language helps develop cognitive skills. Moreover, learning a foreign language has become essential and an increasing number of parents would like their kids to start learning a foreign language at an early age. However, engaging little kids with learning activities is challenging. In this study, we propose a framework for developing a language learning software tool utilizing Augmented Reality (AR), Voicebots, and ChatGPT (an AI utilizing the Large Language Model) technologies to provide a unique product for small kids to teach a foreign language. With AR and Voicebots, the product will grab attention, motivate and provide an entertaining learning environment. The capabilities of ChatGPT will be utilized to efficiently prepare the content for the software tool. We utilize the capabilities of ChatGPT to generate interactive dialogs that will be hosted at Google DialogFlow. We believe the framework and the design principles we propose in this study can be a blueprint for developing highly effective foreign language teaching software.

Stance detection refers to the task of extract-ing the standpoint (Favor, Against or Neither) towards a target in given texts. Such research gains increasing attention with the pro-liferation of social media contents. The conventional framework of handling stance detection is converting it into text classiï¬cation tasks. Deep learning models have already re-placed rule-based models and traditional machine learning models in solving such problems. Current deep neural networks are fac-ing two main challenges which are insufï¬-cient labeled data and information in social media posts and the unexplainable nature of deep learning models. A new pre-trained language model chatGPT was launched on Nov 30, 2022. For the stance detection tasks, our experiments show that ChatGPT can achieve SOTA or similar performance for commonly used datasets including SemEval-2016 and P-Stance. At the same time, ChatGPT can provide explanation for its own prediction, which is beyond the capability of any existing model. The explanations for the cases it cannot provide classiï¬cation results are especially useful. ChatGPT has the potential to be the best AI model for stance detection tasks in NLP, or at least change the research paradigm of this ï¬eld. ChatGPT also opens up the possibility of building explanatory AI for stance detection.

It is freely accessible through a web portal created by the toolâ€™s developer, OpenAI. The programâ€”which automatically creates text based on written promptsâ€”is so popular that itâ€™s likely to be â€œat capacity right nowâ€ if you attempt to use it. When you do get through, ChatGPT provides endless entertainment. I asked it to rewrite the first scene of the classic American play Death of a Salesman, but to feature Princess Elsa from the animated movie Frozen as the main character instead of Willy Loman. The output was an amusing conversation in which Elsaâ€”who has come home from a tough day of sellingâ€”is told by her son Happy, â€œCome on, Mom. Youâ€™re Elsa from Frozen. You have ice powers and youâ€™re a queen. Youâ€™re unstoppable.â€ Mash-ups like this are certainly fun, but there are serious implications for generative AI programs like ChatGPT in science and academia.

During the last two years there has been a plethora of large generative models such as ChatGPT or Stable Diï¬€usion that have been published. Concretely, these models are able to perform tasks such as being a general question and answering system or automatically creating artistic images that are revolutionizing several sectors. Consequently, the implications that these generative models have in the industry and society are enormous, as several job positions may be transformed. For example, Generative AI is capable of transforming eï¬€ectively and cre-atively texts to images, like the DALLE-2 model; text to 3D images, like the Dreamfusion model; images to text, like the Flamingo model; texts to video, like the Phenaki model; texts to audio, like the AudioLM model; texts to other texts, like ChatGPT; texts to code, like the Codex model; texts to scientiï¬c texts, like the Galactica model or even create algorithms like AlphaTensor.

A Preliminary Study	This report provides a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for machine translation, including translation prompt, multilingual translation, and translation robustness. We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its translation ability and ï¬nd that the candidate prompts generally work well and show minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test sets 1 , we ï¬nd that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags behind signiï¬cantly on low-resource or distant languages. For distant languages, we explore an interesting strategy named pivot prompting that asks ChatGPT to translate the source sentence into a high-resource pivot language before into the target language, which improves the translation performance signiï¬cantly. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but is potentially a good translator for spoken language.

Given a test suite, standard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space of software edits to ï¬nd test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair methods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods, which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still suitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug ï¬xing performance of ChatGPT, however, is so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard bug ï¬xing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the perfor- mance with the results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We ï¬nd that ChatGPTâ€™s bug ï¬xing performance is competitive to the common deep learning approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches, ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the expected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be entered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further increased, ï¬xing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art.	ArXiv	1/20/2023	[{'authorId': '51040229', 'name': 'D.

This study aimed to compare the knowledge and interpretation ability of ChatGPT, a language model of artificial general intelligence, with those of medical students in Korea by administering a parasitology examination to both ChatGPT and medical students. The examination consisted of 79 items and was administered to ChatGPT on January 1, 2023. The examination results were analyzed in terms of ChatGPT's overall performance score, its correct answer rate by the items' knowledge level, and the acceptability of its explanations of the items. ChatGPT's performance was lower than that of the medical students, and ChatGPT's correct answer rate was not related to the items' knowledge level. However, there was a relationship between acceptable explanations and correct answers. In conclusion, ChatGPT's knowledge and interpretation ability for this parasitology examination were not yet comparable to those of medical students in Korea.

Objective: To assess the feasibility of using ChatGPT or a similar AI-based chatbot for patient-provider communication. Design: Survey in January 2023 Setting: Survey Participants: A US representative sample of 400 study participants aged 18 and above was recruited on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform for academic studies. 384 participants filled out the full survey. After removing participants who spent less than 3 minutes on the survey, 360 respondents remained. 53.3% of respondents analyzed were women; their average age was 45.4. Exposure(s): Ten representative non-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted from the EHR. Patients' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to respond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's response. In the survey, each patient's question was followed by a provider- or ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five responses were provider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants were asked, and incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response source. Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots' functions in patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Main outcome: Proportion of responses correctly classified as provider- vs chatbot-generated. Secondary outcomes: Average and standard deviation of responses to trust questions. Results: The correct classification of responses ranged between 23.4% to 86.7% for different questions. On average, chatbot responses were identified correctly 60.0% of the time and provider responses were identified correctly 62.3% of the time. On average, responses toward patients' trust in chatbots' functions were weakly positive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower trust as the health-related complexity of the task in questions increased. Conclusions and Relevance: ChatGPT responses to patient questions were close to indistinguishable from provider responses. Laypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer lower risk health questions. It is important to continue studying patient-chatbot interaction as chatbots move from administrative to more clinical roles in healthcare.	medRxiv	1/24/2023	[{'authorId': '71575036', 'name': 'O.

The large language-model (LLM) has signiï¬cantly impacted businesses such as report summarization softwares and copywriters. Observa-tions indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for ac- countable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difï¬culties in advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT 1 to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) Bias 2) Reliability 3) Robustness 4) Toxicity . In accordance with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample datasets. We ï¬nd that a signiï¬cant number of ethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case studies. In addition, we examine the implications of our ï¬ndings on the AI ethics of ChatGPT, as well as future problems and practical design considerations for LLMs. We believe that our ï¬ndings may give light on future efforts to determine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines in LLM applications.

We carry out an extensive technical evaluation of ChatGPT using 21 data sets covering 8 different common NLP application tasks. We evaluate the multitask, multilingual and multi-modal aspects of ChatGPT based on these data sets and a newly designed multimodal dataset. We find that ChatGPT outperforms LLMs with zero-shot learning on most tasks and even outperforms fine-tuned models on some tasks. We find that it is better at understanding non-Latin script languages than generating them. It is able to generate multimodal content from textual prompts, via an intermediate code generation step. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT is 64.33% accurate on average in 10 different reasoning categories under logical reasoning, non-textual reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, hence making it an unreliable reasoner. It is, for example, better at deductive than inductive reasoning. ChatGPT suffers from hallucination problems like other LLMs and it generates more extrinsic hallucinations from its parametric memory as it does not have access to an external knowledge base. Finally, the interactive feature of ChatGPT enables human collaboration with the underlying LLM to improve its performance, i.e, 8% ROUGE-1 on summarization and 2% ChrF++ on machine translation, in a multi-turn"prompt engineering"fashion.

More recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose"large language models", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text spanning code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end-users. The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with solving common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT can provide correct or partially correct answers in 44% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 57% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct answers. Based on these findings, we discuss the potential promise, and dangers related to the use of ChatGPT by students and instructors.

Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of a solution which allow users to interact with data using natural language queries. However, the implementation of NLIs is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and frequent underspecification of user queries. This study proposes using large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which leverages LLMs and demonstrates how effective prompt engineering can be conducted in order to extract from LLMs the desired code for visualisations. Chat2VIS shows that the use of pre-trained LLMs together with the proposed priming prompts, offers an accurate and reliable approach to generating visualisations from natural language queries, even those that are highly misspecified and underspecified. This approach demonstrates gains in efficiency and cost reduction in the development of these systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules. The study compares the performance of two types of GPT-3 models and ChatGPT, while demonstrating that the proposed approach is secure, privacy-preserving, and generalisable to different datasets.

This study aims at investigating how early-stage AI-based transformers can support researchers in designing and conducting an epidemiological study. To accomplish this, we used ChatGPT to reformulate the STROBE recommendations into a list of questions to be answered by the transformer itself. We then qualitatively evaluated the coherence and relevance of the transformers outputs. Study design: Descriptive study. Methods. We first chose a study to be used as a basis for the simulation. We then used ChatGPT to transform each STROBE checklist item into specific prompts. Each answer to the respective prompt was evaluated by independent researchers in terms of coherence and relevance. Results. The mean scores assigned to each prompt were heterogeneous. On average, for the coherence domain, the overall mean score was 3.6 out of 5.0, and for relevance it was 3.3 out of 5.0. The lowest scores were assigned to items belonging to the Methods section of the checklist. Conclusions. ChatGPT can be considered as a valuable support for researchers in conducting an epidemiological study, following internationally recognized guidelines and standards. It is crucial for the users to have knowledge on the subject and a critical mindset when evaluating the outputs. The potential benefits of AI in scientific research and publishing are undeniable, but it is crucial to address the risks, and the ethical and legal consequences associated with its use.	medRxiv	2/8/2023	[{'authorId': '1992720036', 'name': 'F.

However, AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers, professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and suggest four strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. In particular, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers.

Design We explored the capabilities of ChatGPT for generating and rewriting vignettes. First, we gave it natural language prompts to generate 10 new sets of 10 vignettes, each set for a different common childhood illness. Next, we had it generate 10 sets of 10 vignettes given a set of symptoms from which to draw. We then had it rewrite 15 existing pediatric vignettes at different levels of health literacy. Fourth, we asked it to generate 10 vignettes written as a parent, and rewrite these vignettes as a physician, then at a grade 8 reading level, before rewriting them from the original parent's perspective. Finally, we evaluated ChatGPT for diagnosis and triage for 45 clinical vignettes previously used for evaluating symptom checkers. Setting and participants ChatGPT, a publicly available, free chatbot. Main outcome measures Our main outcomes for de novo vignette generation were whether ChatGPT followed vignette creation instructions consistently, correctly, and listed reasonable symptoms for the disease being described. For generating vignettes from pre-existing symptom sets, we examined whether the symptom sets were used without introducing extra symptoms. Our main outcome for rewriting existing standardized vignettes to match patient demographics, and rewriting vignettes between styles, was whether symptoms were dropped or added outside the original vignette. Finally, our main outcomes examining diagnostic and triage accuracy on 45 standardized patient vignettes were whether the correct diagnosis was listed first, and if the correct triage recommendation was made. Results ChatGPT was able to quickly produce varied contexts and symptom profiles when writing vignettes based on an illness name, but overused some core disease symptoms. It was able to use given symptom lists as the basis for vignettes consistently, adding one additional (though appropriate) symptom from outside the list for one disease. Pediatric vignettes rewritten at different levels of health literacy showed more complex symptoms being dropped when writing at low health literacy in 87.5% of cases. While writing at high health literacy, it added a diagnosis to 80% of vignettes (91.7% correctly diagnosed). Symptoms were retained in 90% of cases when rewriting vignettes between viewpoints. When presented with 45 vignettes, ChatGPT identified illnesses with 75.6% (95% CI, 62.6% to 88.5%) first-pass diagnostic accuracy and 57.8% (95% CI, 42.9% to 72.7%) triage accuracy. Its use does require monitoring and has caveats, which we discuss. Conclusions ChatGPT was capable, with caveats and appropriate review, of generating, rewriting, and evaluating clinical vignettes.	medRxiv	2/8/2023	[{'authorId': '2070976921', 'name': 'J. BenoÃ®t'}]

The Implications of Large Language Models for Medical Education and Knowledge Assessment.	BACKGROUND Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a 175-billion-parameter natural language processing model that can generate conversation-style responses to user input.   OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability.   METHODS We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT's performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT's performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question.   RESULTS Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT's answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively.   CONCLUSIONS ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT's capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning.

53	4cd3ae84e24cfff89ef022e36991df314aac83e2	Will ChatGPT get you caught? Rethinking of Plagiarism Detection	The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on education has been a topic of growing concern in recent years. The new generation AI systems such as chatbots have become more accessible on the Internet and stronger in terms of capabilities. The use of chatbots, particularly ChatGPT, for generating academic essays at schools and colleges has sparked fears among scholars. This study aims to explore the originality of contents produced by one of the most popular AI chatbots, ChatGPT. To this end, two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of 50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover, ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI technology on education. Further implications are discussed in the paper.		2/8/2023	[{'authorId': '88352234', 'name': 'M. Khalil'}, {'authorId': '1940086', 'name': 'Erkan Er'}]
54	4ec53531cc7c4cde9437dda51ffb173367bb7e25	Assessing the performance of ChatGPT in answering questions regarding cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) require extensive care. Personalized education can improve their outcomes. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a natural language processing model, has shown potential to provide professional yet patient-freindly responses. Aim: To examine the accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT in responding to questions regarding knowledge, management, and emotional support for cirrhosis and HCC. Method: ChatGPT's responses to 164 frequently asked questions were independently graded by two transplant hepatologists, with a third reviewer resolving any discrepancies. We also compared the performance of ChatGPT on two previously validated and published questionnaires to the physicians or trainees who were tested in the included publications. Furthermore, we formulated the 26 quality measures of cirrhosis management into questions and tested ChatGPT's knowledge in cirrhosis care. Finally, the capacity to provide emotional support to patients or caregivers was tested. Results: ChatGPT regurgitated extensive knowledge about both cirrhosis and HCC, but for questions with correct responses, only a small proportion was labelled as comprehensive. The performance was better in basic knowledge, lifestyle, and treatment than in the domains of diagnosis and preventive medicine. For the quality measures, the model answered 76.9% of questions correctly but failed to specify the cut-off values for making medical decisions and treatment durations. When compared to physicians/trainees, ChatGPT fell short in knowledge of guidelines varying across geographic regions, such as HCC screening criteria. The model also provided practical and multifaceted advice to patients and caregivers regarding the next steps and adjusting to a new diagnosis. Conclusion: In summary, we analyzed the areas of robustness and limitations of ChatGPT's responses on the management of cirrhosis and HCC and relevant emotional support. ChatGPT may have a role as an adjunct informational tool for patients and physicians to improve outcomes.	medRxiv	2/8/2023	[{'authorId': '6807774', 'name': 'Y.

Recently, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art dialogue model that can converse with its human counterparts with unprecedented capabilities. ChatGPT has witnessed tremendous attention from the media, academia, industry, and the general public, attracting more than a million users within days of its release. However, its explosive adoption for information search and as an automated decision aid underscores the importance to understand its limitations and biases. This paper focuses on one of democratic soci-etyâ€™s most important decision-making processes: political elections. Prompting ChatGPT with 630 political statements from two leading voting advice applications and the nation-agnostic political compass test in three pre-registered experiments, we uncover ChatGPTâ€™s pro-environmental, left-libertarian ideology. For example, ChatGPT would impose taxes on flights, re-strict rent increases, and legalize abortion. In the 2021 elections, it would have voted most likely for the Greens both in Germany (BÃ¼ndnis 90/Die GrÃ¼nen) and in the Netherlands (Groen-Links). Our findings are robust when negating the prompts, reversing the order of the statements, varying prompt formality, and across languages (English, German, Dutch, and Spanish). We conclude by discussing the implications of politically biased conversational AI on society.

Despite the rising popularity and performance of AI, studies evaluating the use of LLMs for clinical decision support are lacking. PURPOSE To evaluate ChatGPT's capacity for clinical decision support in radiology via the identification of appropriate imaging services for two important clinical presentations: breast cancer screening and breast pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared ChatGPT's responses to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for breast pain and breast cancer screening. Our prompt formats included an open-ended (OE) format, where ChatGPT was asked to provide the single most appropriate imaging procedure, and a select all that apply (SATA) format, where ChatGPT was given a list of imaging modalities to assess. Scoring criteria evaluated whether proposed imaging modalities were in accordance with ACR guidelines. RESULTS ChatGPT achieved an average OE score of 1.83 (out of 2) and a SATA average percentage correct of 88.9% for breast cancer screening prompts, and an average OE score of 1.125 (out of 2) and a SATA average percentage correct of 58.3% for breast pain prompts. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT for radiologic decision making, with the potential to improve clinical workflow and responsible use of radiology services.	medRxiv	2/7/2023	[{'authorId': '47652637', 'name': 'A.

With consistent moral advice, it might improve the moral judgment and decisions of users, who often hold contradictory moral beliefs. Unfortunately, ChatGPT turns out highly inconsistent as a moral advisor. Nonetheless, it influences usersâ€™ moral judgment, we find in an experiment, even if they know they are advised by a chatting bot, and they underestimate how much they are influenced. Thus, ChatGPT threatens to corrupt rather than improves usersâ€™ judgment. These findings raise the question of how to ensure the responsible use of ChatGPT and similar AI. Transparency is often touted but seems ineffective. We propose training to improve digital literacy.

Efectivamente, se trata de ChatGPT. Si bien la inteligencia artificial ya venÃ­a ocupando un lugar destacado en diversas noticias, aunque muchas veces enmascarada bajo otras diversas acepciones, el fenÃ³meno ChatGPT ha vuelto a poner en primera plana esta disciplina, asÃ­ como sus efectos, tanto positivos como negativos, en nuestra sociedad. Las reacciones a su lanzamiento, sobre todo influidas por su facilidad de acceso y uso, estÃ¡n siendo de lo mÃ¡s variadas, yendo del entusiasmo de los innovadores y adoptadores tempranos hasta el terror casi apocalÃ­ptico propio de la pelÃ­cula Terminator. De las mÃºltiples aplicaciones de esta herramienta, el mayor debate estÃ¡ centrÃ¡ndose en sus implicaciones en la EducaciÃ³n y en la Academia, por su tremenda potencia para generar textos que perfectamente podrÃ­an pasar por creaciones humanas. Estamos en los albores de una tecnologÃ­a que ha pasado de ser una herramienta de juguete a presentar su candidatura a convertirse en una innovaciÃ³n disruptiva. Que lo consiga o no dependerÃ¡ de muchos factores, pero si no es esta serÃ¡ otra similar. Negarlo o prohibirlo no servirÃ¡ absolutamente de nada para parar el efecto tsunami que ya ha comenzado. Por todo ello, primero hay que entender estas tecnologÃ­as basadas en modelos de lenguaje y conocer tanto sus beneficios como sus puntos dÃ©biles, ademÃ¡s de lo que realmente suponen para un sector de actividad especÃ­fico, como puede ser la EducaciÃ³n. DespuÃ©s de conocer la tecnologÃ­a y la herramienta, se estarÃ­a en condiciones de utilizar (o no) su potencial y de prevenir o detectar sus posibles efectos perniciosos, seguramente cambiando y adaptando procesos que probablemente se tengan muy arraigados y que, por tanto, obliguen a salir de la zona de confort, lo que siempre es causa de resistencia al cambio y de reacciones extremas que, normalmente, no van a parar el camino de una tecnologÃ­a hacia su meseta de productividad cuando esta llegue a ser parte cotidiana de una mayorÃ­a suficiente de usuarios, mÃ¡xime cuando ademÃ¡s se trata de herramientas transversales que van a contagiar sus patrones de uso entre los diferentes dominios de aplicaciÃ³n.

Systematic reviews are comprehensive reviews of the literature for a highly focused research question. These reviews are often treated as the highest form of evidence in evidence-based medicine, and are the key strategy to answer research questions in the medical field. To create a high-quality systematic review, complex Boolean queries are often constructed to retrieve studies for the review topic. However, it often takes a long time for systematic review researchers to construct a high quality systematic review Boolean query, and often the resulting queries are far from effective. Poor queries may lead to biased or invalid reviews, because they missed to retrieve key evidence, or to extensive increase in review costs, because they retrieved too many irrelevant studies. Recent advances in Transformer-based generative models have shown great potential to effectively follow instructions from users and generate answers based on the instructions being made. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the latest of such models, ChatGPT, in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. Through a number of extensive experiments on standard test collections for the task, we find that ChatGPT is capable of generating queries that lead to high search precision, although trading-off this for recall. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. The ability of ChatGPT to follow complex instructions and generate queries with high precision makes it a valuable tool for researchers conducting systematic reviews, particularly for rapid reviews where time is a constraint and often trading-off higher precision for lower recall is acceptable.

By imitating Linux, Mac, and Windows terminal commands and providing an interface for TeamViewer, nmap, and ping, it is possible to create a dynamic environment that can adapt to the actions of attackers and provide insight into their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The paper illustrates ten diverse tasks that a conversational agent or large language model might answer appropriately to the effects of command-line attacker. The original result features feasibility studies for ten model tasks meant for defensive teams to mimic expected honeypot interfaces with minimal risks. Ultimately, the usefulness outside of forensic activities stems from whether the dynamic honeypot can extend the time-to-conquer or otherwise delay attacker timelines short of reaching key network assets like databases or confidential information. While ongoing maintenance and monitoring may be required, ChatGPT's ability to detect and deflect malicious activity makes it a valuable option for organizations seeking to enhance their cyber security posture. Future work will focus on cybersecurity layers, including perimeter security, host virus detection, and data security.

The latest AI language modules can produce original, high quality full short-form (300-word) Physics essays within seconds. These technologies such as ChatGPT and davinci-003 are freely available to anyone with an internet connection. In this work, we present evidence of AI generated short-form essays achieving ï¬rst-class grades on an essay writing assessment from an accredited, current university Physics module. The assessment requires students answer ï¬ve open-ended questions with a short, 300-word essay each. Fifty AI answers were generated to create ten submissions that were independently marked by ï¬ve separate markers. The AI generated submissions achieved an average mark of 71 Â± 2%, in strong agreement with the current module average of 71 Â± 5%. A typical AI submission would therefore most-likely be awarded a First Class, the highest classiï¬cation available at UK universities. Plagiarism detection software returned a plagiarism score between 2 Â± 1% (Grammarly) and 7 Â± 2% (TurnitIn). We argue that these results indicate that current AI MLPs represent a signiï¬cant threat to the ï¬delity of short-form essays as an assessment method in Physics courses.		12/22/2022	[{'authorId': '3982687', 'name': 'W.

Unlike previous chatbots, the latest ChatGPT model from OpenAI supports an advanced understanding of complex coding questions. The research demonstrates thirteen coding tasks that generally qualify as stages in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ranging from credential access to defense evasion. With varying success, the experimental prompts generate examples of keyloggers, logic bombs, obfuscated worms, and payment-fulfilled ransomware. The empirical results illustrate cases that support the broad gain of functionality, including self-replication and self-modification, evasion, and strategic understanding of complex cybersecurity goals.

With ChatGPT and other large models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a â€œBrussels effectâ€ in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article makes suggestions for amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimateand legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liabilityâ€™s scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may only face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems should only be subjected to high-risk * Professor Dr. Philipp Hacker, LL.M.

II regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators thoroughly neglect environmental sustainability in both the AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but potentially also sustainable AI (SAI).	SSRN Electronic Journal	11/25/2022	[{'authorId': '49095886', 'name': 'P. Hacker'}]

While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT are able to leverage patterns in the text to solve a variety of NLP tasks, they fall short in problems that require reasoning. They also cannot reliably explain the answers generated for a given question. In order to emulate humans better, we propose STAR, a framework that combines LLMs with Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show how LLMs can be used to effectively extract knowledge -- represented as predicates -- from language. Goal-directed ASP is then employed to reliably reason over this knowledge. We apply the STAR framework to three different NLU tasks requiring reasoning: qualitative reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and goal-directed conversation. Our experiments reveal that STAR is able to bridge the gap of reasoning in NLU tasks, leading to significant performance improvements, especially for smaller LLMs, i.e., LLMs with a smaller number of parameters. NLU applications developed using the STAR framework are also explainable: along with the predicates generated, a justification in the form of a proof tree can be produced for a given output.

To assess ChatGPT in the field of genetics, we compared its performance to human respondents in answering genetics questions (involving 13,636 responses) that had been posted on social media platforms starting in 2021. Overall, ChatGPT did not perform significantly differently than human respondents, but did significantly better on memorization-type questions versus critical thinking questions, frequently provided different answers when asked questions multiple times, and provided plausible explanations for both correct and incorrect answers.	medRxiv	1/28/2023	[{'authorId': '2115335067', 'name': 'D.

The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.â€™s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt. However, there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal implications, and further consensus is needed for the safe and responsible implementation of AI in dental education.

LLMs are still limited, however, in that they frequently fail at complex reasoning, their reasoning processes are opaque, they are prone to â€˜hallucinateâ€™ facts, and there are concerns about their underlying biases. Letting models verbalize reasoning steps as natural language, a technique known as chain-of-thought prompting, has recently been proposed as a way to address some of these issues. Here we present the ï¬rst release of ThoughtSource, a meta-dataset and soï¿½ware library for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The goal of ThoughtSource is to improve future artiï¬cial intelligence systems by facilitating qualitative understanding of CoTs, enabling empirical evaluations, and providing training data.

Massive pre-trained language models have garnered attention and controversy due to their ability to generate human-like responses: attention due to their frequent indistinguishability from human-generated phraseology and narratives, and controversy due to the fact that their convincingly presented arguments and facts are frequently simply false. Just how human-like are these responses when it comes to dialogues about physics, in particular about the standard content of introductory physics courses? This study explores that question by having ChatGTP, the pre-eminent language model in 2023, work through representative assessment content of an actual calculus-based physics course and grading the responses in the same way human responses would be graded. As it turns out, ChatGPT would narrowly pass this course while exhibiting many of the preconceptions and errors of a beginning learner.		1/28/2023	[{'authorId': '3296536', 'name': 'G. Kortemeyer'}]

However, this method of evaluation is not precise and does not provide a common language for reviewers to communicate with each other. In this paper, we propose that science funding agencies ask reviewers to assign quantitative probabilities to the likelihood of a proposal reaching a particular milestone or achieving technical goals. This approach would encourage reviewers to be more precise in their evaluations and could improve both agency-wide and individual reviewer calibration over time. Additionally, this method would allow funding agencies to identify skilled reviewers and allow reviewers to improve their own performance through consistent feedback. While this method may not be suitable for all types of research, it has the potential to enhance proposal review in a variety of fields.

As of now, ChatGPT can write pretty convincing student-level prose, but it is still not very good at answering quantitatively rich questions. Therefore, for the time being, the preceding concerns may not be shared by a large portion of the numeracy education community. However, as Google and WolframAlpha are definitely capable of answering standard and some non-standard quantitative queries, a future generation of artificial intelligence including both types of capabilities is not out of the question. So, the issue is still relevant to the readers of this journal. As we continue to focus on the higher-level skills and habits of mind that make up quantitative literacy (QL) and quantitative reasoning (QR), we should not forget that basic literacy and numeracy are still foundational building blocks. While AI is making advances in these basic realms, our human students seem to be losing ground, as implied by the most recent NAEP scores. Here we encourage our readership to focus on what makes QL/QR so challenging to teach, to human as well as artificial intelligences.

But truth is highly contested, with many different definitions and approaches. This article discusses the struggle for truth in AI systems and the general responses to date. It then investigates the production of truth in InstructGPT, a large language model, highlighting how data harvesting, model architectures, and social feedback mechanisms weave together disparate understandings of veracity. It conceptualizes this performance as an operationalization of truth, where distinct, often conflicting claims are smoothly synthesized and confidently presented into truth-statements. We argue that these same logics and inconsistencies play out in Instructâ€™s successor, ChatGPT, reiterating truth as a non-trivial problem. We suggest that enriching sociality and thickening â€œrealityâ€ are two promising vectors for enhancing the truth-evaluating capacities of future language models. We conclude, however, by stepping back to consider AI truth-telling as a social practice: what kind of â€œtruthâ€ do we as listeners desire? Keywordsâ€” truthfulness, veracity, AI, large language model, GPT-3, InstructGPT, ChatGPT 1 ar X iv :2 30 1. 12 06 6v 1 [ cs .C Y ] 2 8 Ja n 20 23 ChatGPT was released with great fanfare in December 2022. OpenAIâ€™s latest language model appeared to be powerful and almost magical, generating news articles, writing poetry, and explaining arcane concepts instantly and on demand. But a week later, the coding site StackOverflow banned all answers produced by the model. â€œThe primary problem,â€ explained the staff, â€œis that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produceâ€ (Vincent 2022). For a site aiming to provide correct answers to coding problems, the issue was clear: the AI model was â€œsubstantially harmful.â€ As AI technologies are rolled out into healthcare, academia, human resources, law, and a multitude of other domains, they become de-facto arbiters of truth. Researchers have suggested that vulnerabilities in these models could be deployed by malicious actors to produce misinformation rapidly and at scale (Dhanjani 2021; Weidinger et.al. 2022). But more concerning is the everyday impact of this dependence on automated truth claims. For instance, incorrect advice on medical symptoms and drugs can lead to patient harm or death (Bickmore et al. 2018), with one medical chatbot based on GPT-3 already advising a patient to kill themselves (Quach 2022). Whether in medicine or other domains, belief in the oftenplausible claims of these AI oracles can lead to unwarranted trust in questionable models (Passi and Vorvoreanu 2022). Such potentials increasingly proliferate with AIâ€™s deployment across industries and social fields, testifying to the stakes of truth in AI systems. But while AI systems are increasingly given authority and invested with veracity, truth is highly contested. There are many different understandings of what truth means and how we might arrive at a truthful claim, and how truth may be verified or evaluated. No longer limited to binary notions of true or false, AI systems instead rely on degrees of truth, and may attempt to use a datasetâ€™s implicit features, employ explicit fact checking, or appeal to authority as a method (GarcÃ­a Lozano 2020). Osterlind (2019) suggests that quantitative methods reveal unexpected patterns, challenging old fashioned notions of fact and accuracy based on biased human assumptions. And Maruyama (2022) concludes that truth in data science may be regarded as â€œpost-truth,â€ fundamentally different from truth in traditional science. Choosing an approach to truth and implementing it within a computational system is not given, but must be decided. We stress then that truth in AI is not just technical but also social, cultural, and political, drawing on particular norms and values. And yet we also recognise that the technical matters: translating truth theories into actionable architectures and processes updates them in significant ways. These disparate sociotechnical forces coalesce into a final AI model which purports to tell the truthâ€”and in doing so, our understanding of â€œtruthâ€ is remade. â€œThe ideal of truth is a fallacy for semantic interpretation and needs to be changed,â€ suggested two AI researchers (Welty and Aroyo 2015). This article is interested less in truth as a function of AIâ€”how accurate a given model is, according to criteria. Rather it focuses on what the advent of AIâ€”and specifically of language models like ChatGPTâ€”means for the relation between truth and language. The first section discusses the contested nature of truth and the problems that it represents within AI models. The second section builds on these ideas by examining InstructGPT, an important large language model, highlighting the disparate approaches to evaluating and producing truth embedded in its social and technical layers. The third section discusses how the model synthesizes these disparate approaches into a functional machine that can generate truth claims on demand, a dynamic we term the operationalization of truth. The fourth section shows how these same logics and inconsistencies play out in Instructâ€™s successor, ChatGPT, reiterating once more truth as a non-trivial problem. And the fifth section suggests that enriching sociality and thickening â€œrealityâ€ are two promising vectors for enhancing the truth-evaluating capacities of future language models. We conclude by turning to Foucaultâ€™s Discourse and Truth (2019) to reflect on the role that these verification machines should play. If truth claims emerge from a certain arrangement of social actors and associated expectations, then these questions can be posed about language models as much as human interlocutors: what is the truth we are looking for? Risking paradox, we could ask further: what is AIâ€™s true truth? 1. AIâ€™s Struggle For Truth The de-facto understanding of truth in AI models is centered around â€œground truth.â€ This is often referred to as the â€œfundamental truthâ€ underpinning testing and training data or the â€œrealityâ€ that a developer	ArXiv	1/28/2023	[{'authorId': '73236053', 'name': 'Luke Munn'}, {'authorId': '2733075', 'name': 'L.

Existing works focus on supervised finetuning of pretrained models, based on curated model generations that are preferred by human labelers. Such works have achieved remarkable successes in understanding and following instructions (e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT, etc). However, to date, a key limitation of supervised finetuning is that it cannot learn from negative ratings; models are only trained on positive-rated data, which makes it data inefficient. Because collecting human feedback data is both time consuming and expensive, it is vital for the model to learn from all feedback, akin to the remarkable ability of humans to learn from diverse feedback. In this work, we propose a novel technique called Hindsight Finetuning for making language models learn from diverse human feedback. In fact, our idea is motivated by how humans learn from hindsight experience. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with hindsight feedback, and finetune the model to predict the most preferred output. By doing so, models can learn to identify and correct negative attributes or errors. Applying the method to GPT-J, we observe that it significantly improves results on summarization and dialogue tasks using the same amount of human feedback.

Previous publicly-available transformer models from eighteen months prior and 1000 times smaller failed to provide basic arithmetic. The statistical analysis of four complex datasets described here combines arithmetic manipulations that cannot be memorized or encoded by simple rules. The work examines whether next-token prediction succeeds from sentence completion into the realm of actual numerical understanding. For example, the work highlights cases for descriptive statistics on in-memory datasets that the LLM initially loads from memory or generates randomly using python libraries. The resulting exploratory data analysis showcases the model's capabilities to group by or pivot categorical sums, infer feature importance, derive correlations, and predict unseen test cases using linear regression. To extend the model's testable range, the research deletes and appends random rows such that recall alone cannot explain emergent numeracy.

The research introduces four novel cases where the chatbot fields the questions, asks the questions, both question-answer roles, and finally tries to guess appropriate contextual emotions. One task that humans typically fail but trained chat applications complete involves playing bilingual games of twenty questions (English answers to Spanish questions). Future variations address direct problem-solving using a similar inquisitive format to arrive at novel outcomes deductively, such as patentable inventions or combination thinking.

Recent times have witnessed an increasing number of applications of deep neural networks towards solving tasks that require superior cognitive abilities, e.g., playing Go, generating art, question answering (such as ChatGPT), etc. Such a dramatic progress raises the question: how generalizable are neural networks in solving problems that demand broad skills? To answer this question, we propose SMART: a Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task and the associated SMART-101 dataset, for evaluating the abstraction, deduction, and generalization abilities of neural networks in solving visuo-linguistic puzzles designed speciï¬cally for children in the 6â€“8 age group. Our dataset consists of 101 unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a picture and a question, and their solution needs a mix of several elementary skills, including arithmetic, algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To scale our dataset towards training deep neural networks, we programmatically generate entirely new instances for each puzzle, while retaining their solution algorithm. To benchmark the performance on the SMART-101 dataset, we propose a vision and language meta-learning model using varied state-of-the-art backbone networks. Our experiments reveal that while powerful deep models offer reasonable performances on puzzles that they are trained on, they are not better than random accuracy when analyzed for generalization. We also evaluate the recent ChatGPT large language model on a subset of our dataset and ï¬nd that while ChatGPT produces convincing reasoning abilities, the answers are often incorrect.

They either consist of task-speciï¬c model pipelines, incorporate prior knowledge in the form of manually created constraints or both. In contrast, end-to-end models would not suï¬€er from the overhead of having to model prior knowledge and could learn the nuances of poetry from data alone, reducing the degree of human supervision required. In this work, we investigate end-to-end poetry generation conditioned on styles such as rhyme, meter, and alliteration. We identify and address lack of training data and mismatching tokenization algorithms as possible limitations of past attempts. In particular, we successfully pre-train and release ByGPT5, a new token-free decoder-only language model, and ï¬ne-tune it on a large custom corpus of English and German quatrains annotated with our styles. We show that ByGPT5 outperforms other models such as mT5, ByT5, GPT-2 and ChatGPT, while also being more parameter eï¬ƒcient and performing favorably compared to humans. In addition, we analyze its runtime performance and introspect the modelâ€™s understanding of style conditions. We make our code, models, and datasets publicly available. 1	ArXiv	12/20/2022	[{'authorId': '2138207755', 'name': 'Jonas Belouadi'}, {'authorId': '2620186', 'name': 'Steffen Eger'}]

Natural language processing models are being used in various fields and are gradually expanding their use in the medical field. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the medical information or treatment options that ChatGPT can provide for SIS. Method: Using ChatGPT, which is provided as a free beta test, messages related to SIS were entered, and responses to medical information and treatment options were received and analyzed. Result: ChatGPT not only provided answers to the definition, prevalence, and risk factors of SIS, but also symptoms, diseases with similar symptoms, and orthopedic tests according to the messages input. Additionally, a list of treatment options and exercises were provided. Conclusion: ChatGPT will be able to provide overall useful medical information and treatment options to patients unfamiliar with SIS. However, caution is required as it contains content that may be biased or inappropriate information for patients with SIS. Nevertheless, if natural language processing technology develops further, it is expected to be able to express more detailed medical information and treatment options.	medRxiv	12/18/2022	[{'authorId': '103525980', 'name': 'J.

Two task challenges- summary and question answering- prompt ChatGPT to produce original content (98-99%) from a single text entry and sequential questions initially posed by Turing in 1950. We score the original and generated content against the OpenAI GPT-2 Output Detector from 2019, and establish multiple cases where the generated content proves original and undetectable (98%). The question of a machine fooling a human judge recedes in this work relative to the question of "how would one prove it?" The original contribution of the work presents a metric and simple grammatical set for understanding the writing mechanics of chatbots in evaluating their readability and statistical clarity, engagement, delivery, overall quality, and plagiarism risks. While Turing's original prose scores at least 14% below the machine-generated output, whether an algorithm displays hints of Turing's true initial thoughts (the "Lovelace 2.0" test) remains unanswerable.

As an extension, we also consider the harder problem of generating humorous paper titles. For the latter, we compile the ï¬rst large-scale humor annotated dataset for scientiï¬c papers in the NLP/ML domains, comprising almost 2.5k titles. We evaluate all models using human and automatic metrics. Our human evaluation suggests that our best end-to-end system performs similarly to human authors (but arguably slightly worse). Generating funny titles is more difï¬cult, however, and our automatic systems clearly underperform relative to humans and often learn dataset artefacts of humor. Finally, ChatGPT, without any ï¬ne-tuning, performs on the level of our best ï¬ne-tuned system. 1	ArXiv	12/20/2022	[{'authorId': '2109307862', 'name': 'Yanran Chen'}, {'authorId': '2620186', 'name': 'Steffen Eger'}]

We propose to answer this question using the same criteria we use to answer a similar question: can a human learn machine learning? We automatically answer ï¬nal exams in MITâ€™s, Harvardâ€™s and Cornellâ€™s large machine learning courses and generate new questions at a human level. Recently, program synthesis and few-shot learning solved university-level problem set questions in mathematics and STEM courses at a human level. In this work, we solve questions from ï¬nal exams that differ from problem sets in several ways: the questions are longer, have multiple parts, are more complicated, and span a broader set of topics. We provide a new dataset and benchmark of questions from machine learning ï¬nal exams and code for automatically answering these questions and generating new questions. To make our dataset a reproducible benchmark, we use automatic checkers for multiple choice questions, questions with numeric answers, and questions with expression answers, and evaluate a large free language model, Metaâ€™s OPT, and compare the results with Open AIâ€™s GPT-3, ChatGPT, and Codex. A student survey comparing the quality, appropriateness, and difï¬culty of machine-generated questions with human-written questions shows that across multiple aspects, machine-generated questions are indistinguishable from human-generated questions and are suitable for ï¬nal exams. We perform ablation studies comparing zero-shot learning with few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, GPT-3, ChatGPT, and OPT pre-trained on text and Codex ï¬ne-tuned on code on a range of machine learning topics and ï¬nd that few-shot learning methods perform best.

We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., â€œopen doorâ€ and â€œopen fridgeâ€, â€œwalk upstairsâ€ and â€œwalk downstairsâ€. Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens (â€œopenâ€, â€œwalkâ€), which is easier than learning the joint distribution (â€œopen fridgeâ€, â€œwalk upstairsâ€) and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings.

Due to the impressive performance obtained using Large PreTrained Language Models (LLMs) on many code related tasks, researchers have started to directly use LLMs for APR. However, prior approaches simply repeatedly sample the LLM given the same constructed input/prompt created from the original buggy code, which not only leads to generating the same incorrect patches repeatedly but also miss the critical information in testcases. To address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback. As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation feedback to help the model understand the semantic meaning of the program under test. We evaluate 10 different LLM including the newly developed ChatGPT model to demonstrate the improvement of conversational APR over the prior LLM for APR approach.

166	a9c0d7bad124697e370a1b345508b6bc618a4f64	Ethics of generative AI	Artificial intelligence (AI) and its introduction into clinical pathways presents an array of ethical issues that are being discussed in the JME. The development of AI technologies that can produce text that will pass plagiarism detectors and are capable of appearing to be written by a human author present new issues for medical ethics. One set of worries concerns authorship and whether it will now be possible to know that an author or student in fact produced submitted work. That seems likely to be a general worry for secondary and higher education, as well as for all academic journals. Thus far generative AI chatbots do not seem to be able to produce a fully referenced and wellargued ethics article, but they probably could generate a blog or student essay that would be hard to detect after very minor edits. Many schools and universities have moved to online forms of assessment, and it seems likely that generative AI might cast doubt on the integrity of them and we might see a reversion to handwritten examinations as a solution. As well as these immediate and perhaps obvious ethical concerns, generative AI highlights conceptual challenges that pose more profound ethical questions. JME is committed to publishing highquality articles that further the ethical analysis of an issue within healthcare. Some of the content that the journal publishes reports empirical findings. An article that, for example, describes qualitative findings and then develops an analysis of some normative issues could not be solely authored by generative AI: it cannot do qualitative research. However, generative AI can find publicly available sources and produce ethical arguments and syllogisms. What does that imply about the nature of ethical analysis? If ethical analysis, fundamentally, involves assembling, organising and evaluating words, then perhaps generative AI could replace ethicists. At present, generative AI cannot produce the nuance, depth or originality of a quality ethics article, but it may be a matter of time before they pass a medical ethics version of the Turing test. While those who rely on more analytic approaches to ethics might view this as an ethical apocalypse, there are more subtler ways in which generative AI might be used in authorship that are more positive. For instance, if you experiment with ChatGPT for a while, you might find that when you know what you want to say in a paragraph or subsection, you can prompt it to form the argument you want to make and it will generate a fairly welldrafted paragraph. For authors and for postgraduate students, this might be useful for â€˜throat clearingâ€™ sections which are just laying the terrain for the reader before proceeding. AI chatbots might also play a helpful devilâ€™s advocate: once you make a point in a paragraph, you can ask it to generate a rebuttal. If you experiment with ChatGPT you might find that it can be helpful in that not only does it generate obvious counters, but it often raises things that you might not have immediately thought of. So perhaps generative AI has the potential to pose questions like those that might be raised at a seminar while a paper or book is being refined. Much of the work involved in writing good, innovative and original ethical analysis involves wrestling with high level ideas. If generative AI can aid authors in drafting articles then perhaps they save intellectual effort that could be directed toward the â€˜big pictureâ€™? Many publishers, including the BMJ, are committed to encouraging authors from the Global South to write for journals where the authorship has been primarily from the Global North. Publishing in journals such as the JME can be more difficult when English is not an authorâ€™s first language. Because of the speed at which generative AI can present an authorâ€™s ideas in what is close to idiomatic English, they have the potential to significantly open up authorship, especially for humanities style journals like the JME. Journal and copy editors might also save time and effort when correcting articles. These potential benefits will no doubt come with tradeoffs. For instance, those who struggle to articulate a point in writing may find that to be part of a process that leads to a new insight. Perhaps generative AI runs the risk of making that part of the writing process too easy and lead to missing out on opportunities for insight. While that seems like a valid worry, it might be that this is analogous to the changes in writing that resulted from journals being readily available online. Those of us who are old enough to recall writing before online publishing will have spent time trudging between library stacks and searching hard copies of journals to find a paper and stumbling across other papers and journals, which may have led to new ideas. Complete reliance on online databases has probably reduced those moments but the tradeoff clearly still favours their use. Universities, publishers and journals are likely to be exercised about what this will mean for authorship. How can we know whether work was created by the author or by generative AI? While understandable, these worries might be overstated given what they can do at present. While they might find some publicly available sources to support claims, at present they cannot adequately cite, and the quality of the content they produce is wholly dependent on you asking the right questions or having the right ideas. At present, they can be seen as a very sophisticated thesaurus and we do not worry about authors using those. Perhaps the biggest concern is that some predatory journals may feed off the speed by which lowquality manuscripts can now be generated with AI chatbots, and use the phenomenon to publish huge numbers of mostly useless or misleading ethical analyses. This could flood the journal market and undermine trust in research publications. This may be curbed by introducing the use of AI output detectors, though it may also encourage greater (and much needed) scepticism towards publications, with readers and news writers paying greater attention to where the paper they are reporting on was published, and what the publisherâ€™s standards are. Editorially, journals need to and will continue to be concerned with authorship, but our main focus is on the quality and originality of ideas. It seems likely that generative AI is here to stay and will develop, so journals will need to find ways of figuring out how to work with them.

Could Machine Learning (ML) make fundamental discoveries and tackle unsolved problems in Cosmology? Detailed observations of the present contents of the universe are consistent with the Cosmological Constant Lambda and Cold Dark Matter model, subject to some unresolved inconsistencies ('tensions') among observations of the Hubble Constant and the clumpiness factor. To understand these issues further, large surveys of billions of galaxies and other probes require new statistical approaches. In recent years the power of ML, and in particular 'Deep Learning', has been demonstrated for object classification, photometric redshifts, anomaly detection, enhanced simulations, and inference of cosmological parameters. It is argued that the more traditional 'shallow learning' (i.e. with pre-processing feature extraction) is actually quite deep, as it brings in human knowledge, while 'deep learning' might be perceived as a black box, unless supplemented by explainability tools. The 'killer applications' of ML for Cosmology are still to come. New ways to train the next generation of scientists for the Data Intensive Science challenges ahead are also discussed.

In this paper, we present Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD), a dataset that helps train Harry Potter-like dialogue agents. Such a task is typically viewed as a variant of personalized dialogue agents, but they dif-fer signiï¬cantly in three respects: 1) Harry lived in a virtual world of wizards, thus, real-world commonsense may not apply to Harryâ€™s conversations; 2) Harryâ€™s behavior is strongly linked to background information in conversations: the scene, its attributes and its relationship to other speakers; and 3) Such back-grounds are dynamically altered as the storyline goes on. The HPD dataset, as the ï¬rst dataset to facilitate the study of dialogue agent construction for characters within a story, provides rich contextual information about each dialogue session such as scenes, character attributes, and relations. More importantly, all the background information will change over the course of the story. In addition, HPD could support both dialogue generation and retrieval tasks. We evaluate baselines such as Dialog-GPT and BOB to determine the extent to which they can generate Harry Potter-like responses. The experimental results disappoint us in that although the generated responses are ï¬‚uent, they still seem out of character for Harry. Besides, we validate the current most robust dialogue agent, ChatGPT, which also canâ€™t generate plausible Harry-Potter-like responses in some cases, either. Our results sug-gest that there is much scope for future research.
