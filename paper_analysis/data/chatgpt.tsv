  and Detection"	"The introduction of ChatGPT has garnered widespread attention in both
academic and industrial communities. ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to
a wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive answers
that significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and
usefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to
achieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand,
people are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news,
plagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of
thousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with
questions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and
psychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison
Corpus (HC3). Based on the HC3 dataset, we study the characteristics of
ChatGPT's responses, the differences and gaps from human experts, and future
directions for LLMs. We conducted comprehensive human evaluations and
linguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated content compared with that of humans,
where many interesting results are revealed. After that, we conduct extensive
experiments on how to effectively detect whether a certain text is generated by
ChatGPT or humans. We build three different detection systems, explore several
key factors that influence their effectiveness, and evaluate them in different
scenarios. The dataset, code, and models are all publicly available at

automated program repair techniques have been introduced. Given a test suite,
standard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space
of software edits to find test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair
methods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods,
which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still
suitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, however, is
so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard
bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the
results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that
ChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning
approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for
the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches,
ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the
expected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be
entered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further
increased, fixing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art."

  Learning Model for Detecting Short ChatGPT-generated Text"	"ChatGPT has the ability to generate grammatically flawless and
seemingly-human replies to different types of questions from various domains.
The number of its users and of its applications is growing at an unprecedented
rate. Unfortunately, use and abuse come hand in hand. In this paper, we study
whether a machine learning model can be effectively trained to accurately
distinguish between original human and seemingly human (that is,
ChatGPT-generated) text, especially when this text is short. Furthermore, we
employ an explainable artificial intelligence framework to gain insight into
the reasoning behind the model trained to differentiate between
ChatGPT-generated and human-generated text. The goal is to analyze model's
decisions and determine if any specific patterns or characteristics can be
identified. Our study focuses on short online reviews, conducting two
experiments comparing human-generated and ChatGPT-generated text. The first
experiment involves ChatGPT text generated from custom queries, while the
second experiment involves text generated by rephrasing original
human-generated reviews. We fine-tune a Transformer-based model and use it to
make predictions, which are then explained using SHAP. We compare our model
with a perplexity score-based approach and find that disambiguation between
human and ChatGPT-generated reviews is more challenging for the ML model when
using rephrased text. However, our proposed approach still achieves an accuracy
of 79%. Using explainability, we observe that ChatGPT's writing is polite,
without specific details, using fancy and atypical vocabulary, impersonal, and
typically it does not express feelings."

intelligence (AI) agent, to perform high-level cognitive tasks and produce text
that is indistinguishable from human-generated text. This capacity raises
concerns about the potential use of ChatGPT as a tool for academic misconduct
in online exams. The study found that ChatGPT is capable of exhibiting critical
thinking skills and generating highly realistic text with minimal input, making
it a potential threat to the integrity of online exams, particularly in
tertiary education settings where such exams are becoming more prevalent.
Returning to invigilated and oral exams could form part of the solution, while
using advanced proctoring techniques and AI-text output detectors may be
effective in addressing this issue, they are not likely to be foolproof
solutions. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of
large language models like ChatGPT and to devise strategies for combating the
risk of cheating using these tools. It is crucial for educators and
institutions to be aware of the possibility of ChatGPT being used for cheating
and to investigate measures to address it in order to maintain the fairness and

  ChatGPT?"	"Stance detection refers to the task of extracting the standpoint (Favor,
Against or Neither) towards a target in given texts. Such research gains
increasing attention with the proliferation of social media contents. The
conventional framework of handling stance detection is converting it into text
classification tasks. Deep learning models have already replaced rule-based
models and traditional machine learning models in solving such problems.
Current deep neural networks are facing two main challenges which are
insufficient labeled data and information in social media posts and the
unexplainable nature of deep learning models. A new pre-trained language model
chatGPT was launched on Nov 30, 2022. For the stance detection tasks, our
experiments show that ChatGPT can achieve SOTA or similar performance for
commonly used datasets including SemEval-2016 and P-Stance. At the same time,
ChatGPT can provide explanation for its own prediction, which is beyond the
capability of any existing model. The explanations for the cases it cannot
provide classification results are especially useful. ChatGPT has the potential
to be the best AI model for stance detection tasks in NLP, or at least change
the research paradigm of this field. ChatGPT also opens up the possibility of
building explanatory AI for stance detection."

  ChatGPT's pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation"	"Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts how humans interact with
technology. Recently, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art dialogue
model that can converse with its human counterparts with unprecedented
capabilities. ChatGPT has witnessed tremendous attention from the media,
academia, industry, and the general public, attracting more than a million
users within days of its release. However, its explosive adoption for
information search and as an automated decision aid underscores the importance
to understand its limitations and biases. This paper focuses on one of
democratic society's most important decision-making processes: political
elections. Prompting ChatGPT with 630 political statements from two leading
voting advice applications and the nation-agnostic political compass test in
three pre-registered experiments, we uncover ChatGPT's pro-environmental,
left-libertarian ideology. For example, ChatGPT would impose taxes on flights,
restrict rent increases, and legalize abortion. In the 2021 elections, it would
have voted most likely for the Greens both in Germany (B\""undnis 90/Die
Gr\""unen) and in the Netherlands (GroenLinks). Our findings are robust when
negating the prompts, reversing the order of the statements, varying prompt
formality, and across languages (English, German, Dutch, and Spanish). We
conclude by discussing the implications of politically biased conversational AI

translation, including translation prompt, multilingual translation, and
translation robustness. We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its
translation ability and find that the candidate prompts generally work well and
show minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test
sets, we find that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation
products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags
behind significantly on low-resource or distant languages. For distant
languages, we explore an interesting strategy named $\mathbf{pivot~prompting}$
that asks ChatGPT to translate the source sentence into a high-resource pivot
language before into the target language, which improves the translation
performance significantly. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not
perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit
comments but is potentially a good translator for spoken language. Scripts and

publicly available datasets, as well as hand-crafted ones, and measuring its
performance against other models trained on a mathematical corpus, such as
Minerva. We also test whether ChatGPT can be a useful assistant to professional
mathematicians by emulating various use cases that come up in the daily
professional activities of mathematicians (question answering, theorem
searching). In contrast to formal mathematics, where large databases of formal
proofs are available (e.g., the Lean Mathematical Library), current datasets of
natural-language mathematics, used to benchmark language models, only cover
elementary mathematics. We address this issue by introducing a new dataset:
GHOSTS. It is the first natural-language dataset made and curated by working
researchers in mathematics that (1) aims to cover graduate-level mathematics
and (2) provides a holistic overview of the mathematical capabilities of
language models. We benchmark ChatGPT on GHOSTS and evaluate performance
against fine-grained criteria. We make this new dataset publicly available to
assist a community-driven comparison of ChatGPT with (future) large language
models in terms of advanced mathematical comprehension. We conclude that
contrary to many positive reports in the media (a potential case of selection
bias), ChatGPT's mathematical abilities are significantly below those of an
average mathematics graduate student. Our results show that ChatGPT often
understands the question but fails to provide correct solutions. Hence, if your
goal is to use it to pass a university exam, you would be better off copying

chatbot for patient-provider communication. Participants: A US representative
sample of 430 study participants aged 18 and above. 53.2% of respondents
analyzed were women; their average age was 47.1. Exposure: Ten representative
non-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted from the EHR.
Patients' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to
respond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's
response. In the survey, each patient's question was followed by a provider- or
ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five responses were
provider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants were asked,
and incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response source.
Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots' functions in
patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Results: The
correct classification of responses ranged between 49.0% to 85.7% for different
questions. On average, chatbot responses were correctly identified 65.5% of the
time, and provider responses were correctly distinguished 65.1% of the time. On
average, responses toward patients' trust in chatbots' functions were weakly
positive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower trust as the health-related

empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in
advanced LLMs, there is no systematic examination and user study of the ethics
of current LLMs use. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical
LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method on OpenAI's ChatGPT
to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs.
We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \textit{Bias} 2)
\textit{Reliability} 3) \textit{Robustness} 4) \textit{Toxicity}. In accordance
with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample
datasets. We find that a significant number of ethical risks cannot be
addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case
studies. In addition, we examine the implications of our findings on the AI
ethics of ChatGPT, as well as future problems and practical design
considerations for LLMs. We believe that our findings may give light on future
efforts to determine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines in LLM
applications."

  Search?"	"Systematic reviews are comprehensive reviews of the literature for a highly
focused research question. These reviews are often treated as the highest form
of evidence in evidence-based medicine, and are the key strategy to answer
research questions in the medical field. To create a high-quality systematic
review, complex Boolean queries are often constructed to retrieve studies for
the review topic. However, it often takes a long time for systematic review
researchers to construct a high quality systematic review Boolean query, and
often the resulting queries are far from effective. Poor queries may lead to
biased or invalid reviews, because they missed to retrieve key evidence, or to
extensive increase in review costs, because they retrieved too many irrelevant
studies. Recent advances in Transformer-based generative models have shown
great potential to effectively follow instructions from users and generate
answers based on the instructions being made. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of the latest of such models, ChatGPT, in generating effective
Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. Through a number of
extensive experiments on standard test collections for the task, we find that
ChatGPT is capable of generating queries that lead to high search precision,
although trading-off this for recall. Overall, our study demonstrates the
potential of ChatGPT in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic
review literature search. The ability of ChatGPT to follow complex instructions
and generate queries with high precision makes it a valuable tool for
researchers conducting systematic reviews, particularly for rapid reviews where
time is a constraint and often trading-off higher precision for lower recall is
acceptable."

a valuable tool for enabling new forms of automation for developers. More
recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose ""large language models"",
based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive
datasets of human written text spanning code and natural language. However,
despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting
with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting
their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome
with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and
trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions
and respond to a wide variety of commands from end-users.
  The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent
discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI
tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning
opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of
these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they
perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or
danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in
this poster, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with solving
common questions in a popular software testing curriculum. Our findings
indicate that ChatGPT can provide correct or partially correct answers in 44%
of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 57%
of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a
marginally higher rate of correct answers. Based on these findings, we discuss
the potential promise, and dangers related to the use of ChatGPT by students
and instructors."	[{'name': 'Sajed Jalil'}, {'name': 'Suzzana Rafi'}, {'name': 'Thomas D.

  ChatGPT, Codex and GPT-3 Large Language Models"	"The field of data visualisation has long aimed to generate visualisations
from natural language text. Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has
contributed towards the development of a solution which allow users to interact
with data using natural language queries. However, the implementation of NLIs
is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and frequent
underspecification of user queries. This study proposes using large language
models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language
directly into visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS,
which leverages LLMs and demonstrates how effective prompt engineering can be
conducted in order to extract from LLMs the desired code for visualisations.
Chat2VIS shows that the use of pre-trained LLMs together with the proposed
priming prompts, offers an accurate and reliable approach to generating
visualisations from natural language queries, even those that are highly
misspecified and underspecified. This approach demonstrates gains in efficiency
and cost reduction in the development of these systems, while attaining greater
visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that
use hand-crafted grammar rules. The study compares the performance of two types

are neural networks in solving problems that demand broad skills? To answer
this question, we propose SMART: a Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task
and the associated SMART-101 dataset, for evaluating the abstraction,
deduction, and generalization abilities of neural networks in solving
visuo-linguistic puzzles designed specifically for children in the 6-8 age
group. Our dataset consists of 101 unique puzzles; each puzzle comprises a
picture and a question, and their solution needs a mix of several elementary
skills, including arithmetic, algebra, and spatial reasoning, among others. To
scale our dataset towards training deep neural networks, we programmatically
generate entirely new instances for each puzzle while retaining their solution
algorithm. To benchmark the performance on the SMART-101 dataset, we propose a
vision and language meta-learning model using varied state-of-the-art backbone
neural networks. Our experiments reveal that while powerful deep models offer
reasonable performances on puzzles that they are trained on, they are not
better than random accuracy when analyzed for generalization. We also evaluate

potential honeypot interface in cyber security. By imitating Linux, Mac, and
Windows terminal commands and providing an interface for TeamViewer, nmap, and
ping, it is possible to create a dynamic environment that can adapt to the
actions of attackers and provide insight into their tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs). The paper illustrates ten diverse tasks that a
conversational agent or large language model might answer appropriately to the
effects of command-line attacker. The original result features feasibility
studies for ten model tasks meant for defensive teams to mimic expected
honeypot interfaces with minimal risks. Ultimately, the usefulness outside of
forensic activities stems from whether the dynamic honeypot can extend the
time-to-conquer or otherwise delay attacker timelines short of reaching key
network assets like databases or confidential information. While ongoing
maintenance and monitoring may be required, ChatGPT's ability to detect and
deflect malicious activity makes it a valuable option for organizations seeking
to enhance their cyber security posture. Future work will focus on

using the same criteria we use to answer a similar question: can a human learn
machine learning? We automatically answer final exams in MIT's, Harvard's and
Cornell's large machine learning courses and generate new questions at a human
level. Recently, program synthesis and few-shot learning solved
university-level problem set questions in mathematics and STEM courses at a
human level. In this work, we solve questions from final exams that differ from
problem sets in several ways: the questions are longer, have multiple parts,
are more complicated, and span a broader set of topics. We provide a new
dataset and benchmark of questions from machine learning final exams and code
for automatically answering these questions and generating new questions. To
make our dataset a reproducible benchmark, we use automatic checkers for
multiple choice questions, questions with numeric answers, and questions with
expression answers, and evaluate a large free language model, Meta's OPT, and
compare the results with Open AI's GPT-3, ChatGPT, and Codex. A student survey
comparing the quality, appropriateness, and difficulty of machine-generated
questions with human-written questions shows that across multiple aspects,
machine-generated questions are indistinguishable from human-generated
questions and are suitable for final exams. We perform ablation studies
comparing zero-shot learning with few-shot learning, chain-of-thought

patches for bugs. Due to the impressive performance obtained using Large
Pre-Trained Language Models (LLMs) on many code related tasks, researchers have
started to directly use LLMs for APR. However, prior approaches simply
repeatedly sample the LLM given the same constructed input/prompt created from
the original buggy code, which not only leads to generating the same incorrect
patches repeatedly but also miss the critical information in testcases. To
address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for
program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a
conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to
the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback.
As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid
generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation
feedback to help the model understand the semantic meaning of the program under
test. We evaluate 10 different LLM including the newly developed ChatGPT model
to demonstrate the improvement of conversational APR over the prior LLM for APR

paper, we present Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD), a dataset that helps train Harry
Potter-like dialogue agents. Such a task is typically viewed as a variant of
personalized dialogue agents, but they differ significantly in three respects:
1) Harry lived in a virtual world of wizards, thus, real-world commonsense may
not apply to Harry's conversations; 2) Harry's behavior is strongly linked to
background information in conversations: the scene, its attributes and its
relationship to other speakers; and 3) Such backgrounds are dynamically altered
as the storyline goes on. The HPD dataset, as the first dataset to facilitate
the study of dialogue agent construction for characters within a story,
provides rich contextual information about each dialogue session such as
scenes, character attributes, and relations. More importantly, all the
background information will change over the course of the story. In addition,
HPD could support both dialogue generation and retrieval tasks. We evaluate
baselines such as Dialog-GPT and BOB to determine the extent to which they can
generate Harry Potter-like responses. The experimental results disappoint us in
that although the generated responses are fluent, they still seem out of

different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare,
human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition
performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they
neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find
that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g.,
""open door"" and ""open fridge"", ""walk upstairs"" and ""walk downstairs"". Through
some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names
also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a
sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than
classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning
activities into learning shared tokens (""open"", ""walk""), which is easier than
learning the joint distribution (""open fridge"", ""walk upstairs"") and helps
transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets
originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated
method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects.

helpful and useful for humans, and to align with human and social values.
Existing works focus on supervised finetuning of pretrained models, based on
curated model generations that are preferred by human labelers. Such works have
achieved remarkable successes in understanding and following instructions
(e.g., InstructGPT, ChatGPT, etc). However, to date, a key limitation of
supervised finetuning is that it cannot learn from negative ratings; models are
only trained on positive-rated data, which makes it data inefficient. Because
collecting human feedback data is both time consuming and expensive, it is
vital for the model to learn from all feedback, akin to the remarkable ability
of humans to learn from diverse feedback. In this work, we propose a novel
technique called Hindsight Finetuning for making language models learn from
diverse human feedback. In fact, our idea is motivated by how humans learn from
hindsight experience. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations
paired with hindsight feedback, and finetune the model to predict the most
preferred output. By doing so, models can learn to identify and correct
negative attributes or errors. Applying the method to GPT-J, we observe that it
significantly improves results on summarization and dialogue tasks using the
same amount of human feedback."

  Approach and Lessons for the Future"	"As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI
systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated
move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European
approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and
a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final
cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU
AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual
rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on
AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a
Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and
beyond.
  This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the
Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction,
they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI
liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms
and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and
causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments, which are collected
in an Annex at the end of the paper. Third, based on an analysis of the key
risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of
AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. This includes: a
comprehensive framework for AI liability; provisions to support innovation; an
extension to non-discrimination/algorithmic fairness, as well as explainable
AI; and sustainability. I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via
sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects
in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI
and XAI, but potentially also sustainable AI (SAI)."	{'name': 'Philipp Hacker'}	{'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '#text': 'under peer-review; contains 3 Tables'}	[{'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13960v5', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13960v5', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	{'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '@term': 'cs.CY', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}	[{'@term': 'cs.CY', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}, {'@term': 'cs.AI', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}, {'@term': 'cs.LG', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}, {'@term': 'I.2', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}]
